# SignalWire Video Conference example

This repo demonstrates integration of prebuilt SignalWire Video Conferences
in your custom React UI. Video Conferences expose the [`RoomSession`]
(https://developer.signalwire.com/client-sdk/reference/js-video-roomsession)
object, which you can use to programmatically control the conference.

# Running the App

Simply `git clone`, `npm install`, then `npm start`, as you would any React app.
